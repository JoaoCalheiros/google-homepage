The first project from TheOdinProject - Google Homepage and Google Search page.
I did both(easy and difficult) index.html/style.css and search.html/search.css.
I did not use JavaScript, only html and css, as I tried my best to create a replica of the original pages.
There are many errors and malpractices in my code Im sure. Some things I was unnable to do such as the video ads in the Search page, the sticky divs, and some other
problems I encountered while designing my top and bottom contents (borders, some placings, etc)
This is the first project of this sort that I ever did (I began learning programming with TheOdinProject) and it took me about 10 days to do it.
After these 10 days I think I can say that I do understand html much better as well as css, even tho the later still gives me headaches sometimes.

Criticism is welcome as I try to improve my work everyday and will keep learning until Im done with TheOdinProject and beyond! 

If you read this thank you!
